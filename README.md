ManualMemoryManagementDemo
==========================

Sample Objective-C program that demos manual memory management (without ARC).

This program is meant to illustrate concepts in my series "Understanding Objective-C - Memory Management - Without ARC" - see: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/sshatzdeveloper

To run, be sure to first disable ARC. Instructions for this can be found in the aforementioned tumblr blog - in part 2.

I would love to get feedback from anyone who finds this useful. I would also appreciate comments, suggestions, and corrections where appropriate. Thank you.
